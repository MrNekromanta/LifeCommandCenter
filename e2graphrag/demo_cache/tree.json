    "text": "LifeCommandCenter is a cross-project productivity system that integrates Trello task management with Claude analysis through a three-layer architecture. The STATE layer syncs Trello cards via FastAPI to a PostgreSQL database every 60 minutes. The KNOWLEDGE layer uses E²GraphRAG to build entity graphs and summary trees from conversation audits. The AGENCY layer runs n8n workflows for daily digests, stale task detection, and coaching alerts. Krzysiek, the creator of LifeCommandCenter, works as a PM at ALLMEDICA on EU fintech projects. He uses a Beelink SER9 server with 32GB RAM running Windows as the primary development machine. The project documentation is stored in Google Drive and synced across devices. The entity extraction uses a hybrid approach with three layers. Layer 1 is SpaCy with pl_core_news_lg for Polish and en_core_web_lg for English NER. Layer 2 is an EntityRuler with 591 patterns covering 183 domain-specific entities like project names, tools, and concepts. Layer 3 is Claude Sonnet API, called selectively for chunks with fewer than 5 entities from layers 1 and 2. BiznesValidator is another project by Krzysiek — a SaaS business validation platform that helps entrepreneurs validate their business ideas through automated market analysis, competitor research, and financial projections. It uses Supabase for the backend and Cloudflare for CDN and security. The n8n automation platform is used across multiple projects for workflow automation. In LifeCommandCenter, n8n will provide the proactive agency layer with daily digest emails, stale task alerts when cards remain in progress for more than 14 days, and weekly coaching insights generated by Claude API. Trello serves as the primary task management GUI. Each project has its own board with standardized columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress with WIP limit of 3, Review, and Done. Labels follow a convention with blue, green, and purple for epics, red, yellow, and gray for priorities P1",
